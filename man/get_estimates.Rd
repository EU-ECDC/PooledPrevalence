\arguments{
\item{s}{A vector of pool sizs (number of individual samples in a pool)}

\item{w}{A vector of numbers of tested pools in a study}

\item{k}{A vector of numbers of positive pools in a study}

\item{p_test}{A vector of probabilities of positive pools in a study. if
\code{k} is not provided, it used to generate the expected number of
positive pools}

\item{p}{A vector of prevalences of the disease. if \code{k} and
\code{p_test} is not provided, it used to generate the expected number of
positive pools}

\item{level}{The uncertainty level to use for the confidence/credibility
interval. Must be strictly greater than 0 and less than 1. Defaults to
0.95, which corresponds to a 95 percent confidence interval}

\item{method}{Either Maximum Likelihood Estimation (ML), Conjugate Bayesian
(CB) estimation, Hierarchical MCMC Bayesian estimation (HB)}

\item{a}{\eqn{\alpha} parameter of the Beta prior. The prior is on the test
results in case of \code{method = 'CB'} and on the prevalence estimation in
case of \code{method = 'HB'}}

\item{b}{\eqn{\beta} parameter of the Beta prior. The prior is on the test
results in case of \code{method = 'CB'} and on the prevalence estimation in
case of \code{method = 'HB'}}

\item{iters}{Number of samples to draw when using methods CB e HB.}

\item{hc.chains}{number of chains for the Hierarchical Bayesian method. By
default it's the number of cores determined by
\code{parallel::detectCores()} or as stored in \code{getOption("mc.cores")}}

\item{consider.sensitivity}{whether to consider sample acquisition
sensitivity in the HB estimation}

\item{asens}{\eqn{\alpha} parameter of the Beta distribution describing the
sample acquisition sensitivity}

\item{bsens}{\eqn{\beta} parameter of the Beta distribution describing the
sample acquisition sensitivity}
}
\value{
A list with two components: A named numeric matrix of height equal to
the length of the parameter vectors. The matrix contains:
\describe{\item{p_est}{The positivity rate for the pools in the study}
\item{k}{The number of positive pools} \item{Est}{The estimated disease
prevalence} \item{Lo}{The lower uncertainty bound} \item{Up}{The upper
uncertainty bound} } For methods CB and HB, if just one set of parameters is passed, a dataframe with the posterior
samples is returned.
}
\description{
The function allow to estimate prevalence from the results of prevalence
study. It use three statistical frameworks: Maximum Likelihood estimation
(ML), Conjugate Bayesian (CB) estimation, Hierarchical MCMC Bayesian
estimation (HB).
}
\details{
The CB and HB estimation allows the setting of priors, the first on the study
results, the second on the prevalence estimates themselves; the default prior
is a Beta(0.3, 0.3) distribution to account for the positive bias in the
prevalence estimation in case of low sample size. The HB method allows also
to take in account the sensitivity of the sample acquisition procedure,
distibuted as ~ Beta(asens, bsens). The default parameters describe a mean
sensitivity of 95\% with a lower bound near 70\%.

The function takes in input the pool size, the number of tested pools and the
positive pools. In alternative, to the actual test results, users can provide
only the probability of positive pools in the study or the theoretical mean
prevalence; the expected number of positive pools is then generated throgh
Maximum Likelihood. All parameters study parameters \code{s, w, p_tests, p}
can be vectors; this permit to analyze multiple (real or simulated) studies
at once.

The HB method requires the compilation of a STAN model at the first use. The
model will be compiled only the first time.
